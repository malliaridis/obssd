READ CAREFULLY:
This is a template for reporting a bug.
First things first: check if there is already an issue reporting the same bug where you might 
only provide further information instead of starting a new issue. 
If that is not the case, here are some tips for filling out the following template:
- Hints are not shown in the issue as long as they are commented out
- Comments that are not visible start with `\<!--` and end with `--\>`
- It is recommended to follow the template as much as possible
