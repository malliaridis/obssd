This is a template for requesting new features / enhancements.
There is actually no special format required, but here are some
hints how you could describe or help us better understand your
idea.

# Feature Request

### Describe your idea
<!-- 
Describe here your idea. Try to write your idea in a short 
and long version, so someone reading your short version understands
what you are asking for and a contributor knows with the long 
version what exactly you want to have at the end. 
-->


### Expected behavior and realization
<!-- Add here the expected behavior with optional screenshots or
sketches that helps to understand how it could be roughly implemented. -->
