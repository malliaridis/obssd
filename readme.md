# The OBSSD Project

This is the official project for public bug reporting and feature requests for the
[OBSSD app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.malliaridis.android.obs.app).

## About the Project
### Project status
The project is progressing very slowly because of lack of time. I would like to invest more
time if I could, but since this project is not supported by anyone yet it is difficult to
spend too much time to it.

### Upcoming changes
I am currently working on the version 2.0 which will introduce very useful features, including
support for Streamlabs OBS and QR Codes scanning that is now supported in both, the Palakis
WebSocket plugin and Streamlabs OBS.

## How to contribute
Contribution is very appreciated and can be in any form. Here, it is only important to stay
in contact with me (the developer) so further information can be provided if necessary.

Contribution can be anything from bugs to feature requests or discussion topics. I would
like to get in touch with the users of the app so I can better understand your needs.

## Known issues
Connection problems are currently the most frequent problem the users have. These are mainly
caused because of wrong websocket version or a wrong network setup. With the upcoming 2.0
version this will be better handled by picking the right address from a pool of possible
addresses automatically or notify the user what possible reasons for connection issues could
be (like not in the same subnet).

However, since the upcoming version will take a while until it is released, feel free to get
in touch with me via email or an question issue in this project.

## Support
In the app there is an email provided where you can reach out to me via email. Alternatively,
if you are familiar with GitHub you can create an issue (aka. ticket) with your question. I
usually respond within one or two working days.
